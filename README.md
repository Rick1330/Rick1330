# Rick — AI Systems & Developer Tooling

> Engineering intelligent systems with intention and automation.  
> Based in Ethiopia (UTC+3).

I design and build AI-augmented software systems: multi-agent frameworks, secure automation pipelines, and developer tooling that scales from prototypes to production.

## What I focus on
- **AI systems & agents** — planning, tools, memory, and orchestration
- **Distributed & event-driven backends** — APIs, gateways, schedulers, IaC
- **DX & ops** — robust CLIs, CI/CD, observability, secure defaults

## Featured projects
- **CyberSage — AI-Powered Cybersecurity Co-Pilot**  
  LLM-driven agents that orchestrate standard security tools (Nmap, WHOIS, VirusTotal…), with microservices, REST API, CLI, and a UI. Includes workflows, sandboxed tool runtimes, vector/RAG, and IaC for repeatable deploys.  
  _Python · FastAPI · Celery · Redis · Terraform · NestJS · React_

- **AetherStack — Event-Driven Platform for AI/Data Workloads**  
  Modular stack with a **broker**, **API gateway**, and **workload scheduler** to route, queue, and run jobs reliably—groundwork for scalable agentic systems and services.  
  _Go · Message broker · Job orchestration_

- **Universal AI Documentation System**  
  Multi-agent documentation pipeline: knowledge ingestion, embeddings/vector store, retrieval-augmented responses, and a web UI. Built to keep engineering docs living, searchable, and consistent.  
  _TypeScript · React · LangChain/RAG · Vector DB_  
  → https://github.com/Rick1330/Universal-AI-Documentation-System-Design-Companion

- **Nexus Framework — Composable Multi-Agent Runtime**  
  A modular framework (agents, tools, memory, orchestrator) for building assistants, automation, and decision pipelines with structured outputs and streaming.  
  _Python · Agents/Tools/Memory · Orchestration_  
  → https://github.com/Rick1330/Nexus-Framework

## Also exploring
- **Architech Visual Forge** — fast TypeScript template for modern apps (Next.js/Tailwind/shadcn).  
  → https://github.com/Rick1330/architech-visual-forge
- Following/learning from forks & ecosystems: **OWL (camel-ai)**, **Firecrawl**, **Agent-as-a-Judge**.

## How I work
- Prefer **typed, tested, documented** code and **secure defaults** (secrets scanning, CI checks).
- Ship as **services + CLIs + APIs**, with IaC for reproducible environments.
- Design for **observability** and automation from day one.

## Collaboration
I’m open to collaborating on AI-native tooling, agent platforms, and secure automation systems.  
Open an issue in a repo or start a discussion.
