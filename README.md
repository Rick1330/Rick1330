# Rick â€” AI Systems & Developer Tooling

> Engineering intelligent systems with intention and automation.  
> Based in Ethiopia (UTC+3).

I design and build AI-augmented software systems: multi-agent frameworks, secure automation pipelines, and developer tooling that scales from prototypes to production.

## What I focus on
- **AI systems & agents** â€” planning, tools, memory, and orchestration
- **Distributed & event-driven backends** â€” APIs, gateways, schedulers, IaC
- **DX & ops** â€” robust CLIs, CI/CD, observability, secure defaults

## Featured projects
- **CyberSage â€” AI-Powered Cybersecurity Co-Pilot**  
  LLM-driven agents that orchestrate standard security tools (Nmap, WHOIS, VirusTotalâ€¦), with microservices, REST API, CLI, and a UI. Includes workflows, sandboxed tool runtimes, vector/RAG, and IaC for repeatable deploys.

- **AetherStack â€” Event-Driven Platform for AI/Data Workloads**  
  Modular stack with a **broker**, **API gateway**, and **workload scheduler** to route, queue, and run jobs reliablyâ€”groundwork for scalable agentic systems and services.  
  _Go Â· Message broker Â· Job orchestration_  
  â†’ https://github.com/Rick1330/AetherStack

- **Universal AI Documentation System**  
  Multi-agent documentation pipeline: knowledge ingestion, embeddings/vector store, retrieval-augmented responses, and a web UI. Built to keep engineering docs living, searchable, and consistent.  
  _TypeScript Â· React Â· LangChain/RAG Â· Vector DB_  
  â†’ https://github.com/Rick1330/Universal-AI-Documentation-System-Design-Companion

- **Nexus Framework â€” Composable Multi-Agent Runtime**  
  A modular framework (agents, tools, memory, orchestrator) for building assistants, automation, and decision pipelines with structured outputs and streaming.  
  _Python Â· Agents/Tools/Memory Â· Orchestration_  
  â†’ https://github.com/Rick1330/Nexus-Framework

## Also exploring
- **Architech Visual Forge** â€” fast TypeScript template for modern apps (Next.js/Tailwind/shadcn).  
  â†’ https://github.com/Rick1330/architech-visual-forge
- Following/learning from forks & ecosystems: **OWL (camel-ai)**, **Firecrawl**, **Agent-as-a-Judge**.

## How I work
- Prefer **typed, tested, documented** code and **secure defaults** (secrets scanning, CI checks).
- Ship as **services + CLIs + APIs**, with IaC for reproducible environments.
- Design for **observability** and automation from day one.

## Collaboration
Iâ€™m open to collaborating on AI-native tooling, agent platforms, and secure automation systems.
